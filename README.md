# process_my_sony_jpgs

Sony cameras are dumb, they produce around 30MB per shot or even larger, some bursts are not in a group photos, filename sometimes duplicate, I wanna create a tool for myself to batch rename these files and able to do some AI operations.

## current operations
* rename: rename file from XXX to YYYY-MM-DD_XXX
* resize: create a 6666 resolution file.
